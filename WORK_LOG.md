| Sept 24 | 11:15am-11:55am | During this block, I tried to think of different ways that I could solve the problem. The main thing that I thought about was that a set doesn't allow duplicates, so in some way I think that using a set will help to optimize the run time because you don't have to ever remove duplicates at the end. The second thing that I am still playing with is that if you take the text and simply remove words as you go that DO exist in the dictionary, the resulting words are the ones that don't exist and they are in order. However, there are duplicates, and in general I don't think that this is going to be the most efficient way of solving it. |

I think that this will work best if I duplicate the array of strings over to an arraylist, and my idea is to a nested for loop that will index through every word of the dicitonary and see if it matches with the given word in text. However, as I even just write this out, I can tell that it is probably going to take wayyyyy too long, but I am going to try to implement it just as a start. |

So, what I think I'm gonna do next is implement the code from SpellingBee from last year, and see how correct that works. My goal for V1 is to get something that works whether or not it passes the time checks. Again, I doubt SpellingBee will pass the time checks, but I'm thinking that it will almost definitely be faster than what I have now! |
